# SMART-NCOV-CORONA_VIRUS_DETECTOR
The aim is to develop a quick way to detect the nCov 2019 (Coronavirus 2019) strain, with the plan to use convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial neural networks.

# PLANNED STEPS

1. Take as input, blood sample/spatter against a white or clear background.

2. Apply super-resolution to that image using a generative adversarial neural network.

3. Try to identify whether the super-resolved image contains white blood cells that are consistent with the coronavirus.

4. Regarding [haematological diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology), the steps above seek to utilize super resolution methods, as a potential replacement for microscopy, from which classification of coronavirus associated white blood cells may take place?


# WHY?

* The nCov 2019 (Coronavirus Strain 2019) is spreading, with a [mortality rate between 2% and 4%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). 
* Current screening methods may miss the presence of the virus because:
    * The incubation period may constitute 0 symptoms, so temperature scans may miss carriers [with 0 symptoms during incubation](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/01/26/asia-pacific/science-health-asia-pacific/fever-china-virus-detection-harder/).
    * Over the counter pills can be used to lower temperature, again, [averting the temperature scanning/screening measures](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7924801/Chinese-woman-bragged-cheating-airport-coronavirus-screenings-tracked-France.html).


# CALL FOR CONTRIBUTION
I am yet to identify all the tools that may required for this project, and I have not yet determined if the steps are feasible. Software developers/machine learning practitioners could join in to contribute.
