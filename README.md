# SMART-NCOV-CORONA_VIRUS_DETECTOR
The aim is to develop a quick way to detect the nCov 2019 (Coronavirus 2019) strain, with the plan to use convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial neural networks.

# PLANNED STEPS

1. Take as input, peripheral blood smear image slides per patient/human.

2. Train an algorithm to distinquish between nCov positives and negatives, using a Convolutional neural network and the labelled image smears from (1), optimally using federated data associated with nCov.
    * Pass each input image through a super resolution filter or generative adversarial image resolution producer if applicable.

3. Invoke trained algorithm with the ability to within milliseconds, return prediction or classification of new unlabelled image smears, aka detect new cases with good accuracy/confidence, of the latest nCov/coronavirus.
  


# WHY?

* The nCov 2019 (Coronavirus Strain 2019) is spreading, with a [mortality rate between 2% and 4%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). 
* Current screening methods may miss the presence of the virus because:
    * The incubation period may constitute 0 symptoms, so temperature scans may miss carriers [with 0 symptoms during incubation](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/01/26/asia-pacific/science-health-asia-pacific/fever-china-virus-detection-harder/).
    * Over the counter pills can be used to lower temperature, again, [averting the temperature scanning/screening measures](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7924801/Chinese-woman-bragged-cheating-airport-coronavirus-screenings-tracked-France.html).
* This ai driven method will reasonably help to stop [the exponential growth](http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/cherry/200126) of the nCov strain.

# CALL FOR CONTRIBUTION
I am yet to identify all the tools that may required for this project, and I have not yet determined if the steps are feasible. Software developers/machine learning practitioners could join in to contribute.


# DATA?

[Google 25 million datasets](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com)

* Note: Some of the Google datasets pertaining to nCov above may not comply with the data type specied in the "PLANNED STEPS" segment of my page.
